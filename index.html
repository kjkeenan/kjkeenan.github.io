Kaho'olawe is often overlooked, but offers an interesting history nonetheless.</div>

Lāna'i, for thousands of years was mysterious and rarely visited by the Hawai'ians until King Kamehameha I united the islands in 1810 and built a private fishing home for himself there.  With only 30 miles of paved road, Lāna'i keeps itself private and beautiful.  Its terrain is much different than the other islands and shows off its rocky landscape in many places</div>
